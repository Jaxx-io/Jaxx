# Terms of Service
## Version 20170830 

## 1. Parties
This agreement is between you ("You" or "Your" in this agreement) and Decentral Inc. ("Decentral").
## 2. Service Offered
Decentral has created a software program that enables users to access, and transfer virtual currencies, tokens, and cryptocurrencies (collectively, "Digital Asset(s)") under the name "Jaxx" ("Jaxx Software"). This license agreement permits You to use the Jaxx Software subject to certain conditions, rights and obligations. 

You should only use the Jaxx Software if you are familiar with Digital Assets. Decentral highly recommends learning the basics for the Digital Assets that You plan on using with the Jaxx Software before running the Jaxx Software.  

The Jaxx Software is licensed to you without charge.This agreement applies to any technical support provided to You in relation to the Jaxx Software.
## 3. You Own Your Private Keys
Decentral does not store any private keys, backup phrases or passwords (collectively, "Private Key Information"). Private Key Information is stored locally in Your local copy of the Jaxx Software. It is very important that You backup Your Private Key Information. If You lose Your Private Key Information then it will not be possible for Decentral to recover it for You and You may permanently lose access to Your Digital Assets. 

If You do not understand the above paragraph then Decentral recommends that You learn more about Digital Assets before using the Jaxx Software.
## 4. User Obligations
You shall:
a) be of age of majority in Your local jurisdiction; and,
b) be responsible for Your own Digital Assets; and,
c) backup/write down Your "backup phrase" and keep it private; and,
d) carefully guard Your private keys; and,
e) carefully review the list of supported Digital Assets before engaging in any transactions; and,
f) ensure that Your device(s) are fully updated and do not contain viruses, malware or otherwise malicious software; and,
g) ensure that Your use of the Jaxx Software complies with Canadian and local laws. 

You shall not:
a) deposit Digital Assets into addresses for Digital Assets that are not supported by the Jaxx Software; or,
b) use the Jaxx Software in a manner likely to interfere with other Jaxx Software users or servers (e.g. excessive API calls or network spam); or,
c) use the Jaxx Software in a manner contrary to the laws of Canada or Your local laws.
## 5. No Control Over Blockchains
Decentral is not the creator of, and does not have any control over, any of the Digital Assets that the Jaxx Software allows You to use. You shall be solely responsible for Your choice of and use of Digital Assets.
## 6. Third Party Integrations
The Jaxx Software integrates with third party services. 

Although the Jaxx Software makes it easy to engage with integrated third parties, Decentral shall not be responsible for any consequences resulting from Your use of third party integrated services. If You require assistance with a third-party integration then You should contact that third party.
## 7. Transactions
The only authentic record of Digital Assets transactions is the applicable blockchain. 

The Jaxx Software provides functionality that allows You to send Digital Asset transfer instructions. Decentral does not guarantee that transactions You perform using the Jaxx Software shall be stored in any blockchain. 

You must ensure that Your transactions conform to the applicable rules of the software for the Digital Asset (especially with smart contract systems like Ethereum).  

There may be transaction fees (e.g. mining fees) associated with Digital Asset transactions that are required by the system You engage with. Decentral shall not be responsible for any losses You incur due to transaction fees or losses that occur due to incorrectly set transaction fees (i.e. too low or high).
